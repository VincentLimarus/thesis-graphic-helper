The study evaluates four experimental approaches: 
1. EfficientNetB0 trained on a combined dataset (80:20 ratio of clean to damaged fingerprints).
2. EfficientNetB0 trained exclusively on clean fingerprint images.
3. VGG16 trained on a combined dataset (80:20 ratio of clean to damaged fingerprints).
4. VGG16 trained exclusively on clean fingerprint images.
